Simple Cocoa ISBN lookup example code using the 
forsale.objectsinspaceandtime.com REST API.

Compile it by pressing the button in Xcode (circa 3.2.2).
Test it by entering an ISBN number in the ensuant dialog box,
 and then waiting a second or so. 

Maybe you're wondering why an ObjC toy is the only definitive
comment from the entire forsale.objectsinspaceandtime.com
Developer Zone(tm)... I mean, is there any actual API
documentation? No. Is there a versioning or release schedule
plan? Also, no. Is there any iOS sample code? No. Is there a
place where forsale.objectsinspaceandtime.com site members
might be able to download the iSight barcode scanner (source
or otherwise)? Yeah, no.

All of the "no" instances in the last graf are technically
really not-just-yets -- but look I saw what happened to the
TextMate guy, and like him, I am but one man with a laptop
and a geeky dream. So in the meantime, until it all gets
dreampt, here's a demo I can definitively put out there.

More may follow, but maybe it won't -- low expectations mean
less exposure to hazardous software vapors for us both.
I will gladly send you more sample code or back-of-the-
envelope HOWTOs on the API if you show any sort of
sensible interest -- try me. In any case have fun dogg.
